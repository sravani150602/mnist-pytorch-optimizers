# MNIST Optimizer Showdown with PyTorch

This notebook explores how different optimizers impact the performance of a simple neural network trained on the MNIST handwritten digits dataset using PyTorch.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- Python
- PyTorch
- torchvision (for loading MNIST)
- Matplotlib (for visualization)

## 📊 What This Notebook Covers
- Loading and preprocessing the MNIST dataset
- Defining a simple feedforward neural network
- Training the model using different optimization algorithms
- Comparing model performance based on accuracy and training loss
- Visualizing convergence and performance differences

## 🧠 Optimizers Compared (if applicable)
- SGD
- Adam
- RMSprop
*(Feel free to list actual optimizers you used)*

## 📎 Dataset
The MNIST dataset is automatically downloaded using `torchvision.datasets`.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
2. Make sure `torch` and `torchvision` are installed
3. Run the notebook sequentially
